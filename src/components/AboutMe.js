        <p>My name is Cole, and I enjoy creating websites, apps, and even games! I recently graduated (May 2021) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Between my coursework and personal projects, I've done a lot of programming in multiple languages, and have utilized a wide variety of tools, frameworks, and libraries. In the rest of my free time, I love hiking, playing guitar, and exploring new places!  </p>
